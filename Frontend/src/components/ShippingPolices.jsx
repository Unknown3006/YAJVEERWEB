        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Accurate Information:</strong> It is crucial that you
            provide accurate and complete shipping address and contact
            information (including mobile number) at the time of placing your
            order. We are not responsible for delays or failed deliveries

            attempts, the package will be returned to our warehouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Re-shipping Charges:</strong> In cases of non-delivery due
            to incorrect address, refusal of delivery, or unavailability of the
            recipient after multiple attempts, you may be responsible for the
            re-shipping charges to have the order sent out again. Refunds for
            such returned orders (if applicable) will be processed after
            deducting the original shipping costs and any return processing fees.
